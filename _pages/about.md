Welcome! My name is Ren (Ryan) Li. I am a senior undergraduate studying finance and statistics at the [School of Finance](http://en.finance.nankai.edu.cn/), [Nankai University](https://en.nankai.edu.cn/) (NKUSF). I am also an incoming master's student of Fintech at NKUSF in Fall 2024.

During my bachelor's studies, I have found an extraordinary passion for utilizing mathematical models and programming simulation to solve real-world problems and reveal the underlying mechanisms of the business and financial world through taking courses and conducting research in various finance, statistics, and artificial intelligence domains. My current research interests are in Financial Econometrics, Asset Pricing, Operations Research, and Machine Learning. 

Aspiring to address frontier problems in the real world and delve into the fundamentals of finance and management with precise mathematical and simulation methods, I am committed to pursuing a p.h.d. in Operations Research, Financial Engineering, Fintech, and Management Science.
