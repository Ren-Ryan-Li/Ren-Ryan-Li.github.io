Welcome! My name is Ren (Ryan) Li. I am a senior undergraduate studying finance and statistics and an incoming master's student of Fintech at the [School of Finance](http://en.finance.nankai.edu.cn/), [Nankai University](https://en.nankai.edu.cn/). During my bachelor's studies, I have found an extraordinary passion for utilizing mathematical models and computer programming to solve real-world problems and to reveal the underlying mechanisms of the business and financial world. After taking courses and conducting research in various domains of finance, statistics, and artificial intelligence, my current research interests have been in Financial Econometrics, Asset Pricing, Operations Research, and Machine Learning. 

A data-driven personal website
======
Like many other Jekyll-based GitHub Pages templates, Academic Pages makes you separate the website's content from its form. The content & metadata of your website are in structured markdown files, while various other files constitute the theme, specifying how to transform that content & metadata into HTML pages. You keep these various markdown (.md), YAML (.yml), HTML, and CSS files in a public GitHub repository. 

 If you get to a point where you've broken something in Jekyll/HTML/CSS beyond repair, your markdown files describing your talks, publications, etc. are safe. You can rollback the changes or even delete the repository and start over -- just be sure to save the markdown files! Finally, you can also write scripts that process the structured data on the site, such as [this one](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/talkmap.ipynb) that analyzes metadata in pages about talks to display [a map of every location you've given a talk](https://academicpages.github.io/talkmap.html).
