Welcome! My name is Ren (Ryan) Li. I am a senior undergraduate studying finance and statistics at the [School of Finance](http://en.finance.nankai.edu.cn/), [Nankai University](https://en.nankai.edu.cn/) (NKUSF). I am also an incoming master's student of Fintech supervised by [Prof. Tingting Cheng](https://sites.google.com/site/tingtingcheng2014/home) at NKUSF in Fall 2024.

During my bachelor's studies, I found my extraordinary passion for utilizing mathematical models and programming simulation to solve real-world problems and reveal the underlying mechanisms of the business and financial world. Throughout taking courses and conducting research in various finance, statistics, and artificial intelligence domains, my current research interests have been in Financial Econometrics, High-dimensional Statistics, Machine Learning, and Operations Research.

Aspiring to address frontier problems in the real world and to delve into the fundamentals of finance and management with precise mathematical and simulation methods, I am committed to pursuing a p.h.d. in Financial Econometrics, Statistics, Operations Research, Management Science, and related fields.
